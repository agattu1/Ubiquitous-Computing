Individuals with mobility impairments have witnessed substantial
advancements in the field of motorized wheelchairs, affording them
newfound independence. No longer reliant on assistance for mobility,
they can now navigate autonomously. However, this independence,
while liberating, ushers in new challenges. With users now moving
independently and without supervision, scenarios may arise where
the wheelchair becomes immobilized. Given that such incidents
can also involve the user’s phone being inaccessible, there arises
a pressing need for a sophisticated system capable of promptly detecting and alerting emergency contacts in such precarious situations.
Our study introduces a modular, multisensory, seamlessly integrated,
and assistive device designed specifically for the mobility-impaired
audience— a wheelchair crash detection and service system. The
presented system essentially is a planet of two overarching parts:
system implementation and user-interface. The system implementation section comprises of four subsidiaries, each equipped with
defining sensors, control elements, buzzers, displays, speakers, and
transducers. A notable feature of the system implementation is the
focus on sensor-based context awareness, motivated by integrating
various peripherals to achieve sensor fusion, which otherwise cannot
be derived from a single sensor. The user-interface section is further
divided into two categories. The primary category involves server
provisioning/dispatch, SMTP communication, and audible speech,
while the secondary category features visual notification outpost
directly on the wheelchair. The iterative phases of the R&D have
been executed under the agile methodology and the results have
been reported on the experiments. This study contributes to ongoing
institutional research at Georgia Institute of Technology and is housed
under the Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing (MUC) group, affiliated
with Georgia Tech ABLE Alliance, and extends to all caregivers who
prioritize wheelchair safety for their patients.
